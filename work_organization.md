Welcome to __"montpellier_network"__, in this section we will describe the repartition of tasks between the team members, we have chosen to break down the project into three main tasks, distributed between the team members as follows :

* __Pre-processing__ : x1 has for task to download and process images of a car, a pedestrian and a bicycle, and will remove all pixels that don't need to appear on our video. (Abdesstar)


* __Images generating__ : x2 will create a code that must be able to read an image and plot it on top of an "osmnx graph" in a specific position, the code will generate a sequence of images (200 or more) that will be used to create our animation. (Fanchon)


* __Video and widget__ : finally, x3 will create a code that is able to read images and create a video and a widget out of them. Therefore, it will use the images created in the previous task to create a widget and a video. 

The widget and the animation were created by Fanchon.

Please note that this repartition is flexible and can be changed.
